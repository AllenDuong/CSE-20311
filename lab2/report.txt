The final part of the assignment required a program to be developed that
generates a simple ASCII Art graph of a mathematical function. The program also stated
the function and range after displaying the graph. The function and range chosen were
y=x*sin(cos(x)) on the range [0,20].

From the user perspective, once the program is run no other input is required. The
program displays a line that states the function and the range then displays a graph of
the function. THe graph reads line by line and also displays the corresponding x and y values.
Once the graphing has ended, the program displays the location and value of an absolute minimum
and maximum. If multiple maxima or minima exist, only a single location and value is displayed.

On the back end, the domain was hard coded in and the values for y were determined through iteration 
of a for loop. Varrious conditionals were used to keep track of the current max and mimimum values,
as well as the locations of those values. A change in x value was also hard coded in. The larger 
this value, the less detailed the graph would be. The correctness of the program, including the graph
and the max and min values, were validated through an external graphing program.
