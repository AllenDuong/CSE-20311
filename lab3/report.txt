From the user perspective, the program works as a simple text-based 4-function 
calculator. The menu is repeatedly shown until an input value is entered. When
a valid value is entered, the user is prompted for two values and the corresponding
math operation is performed on them. The output of that operation is then shown to
the user, and the menu is once again displayed. This process is repeated until the 
user enters the appropriate value to exit the program. 

Internally, a while loop is run in which the menu text is constantly displayed and the user's 
input is repeatedly checked. Once an appropriate value is entered, an if conditional calls the 
appropriate function for that math operation. Within the called 
void function, the user is prompted to enter in values and the math operation is calculated.
The result is then displayed to the user then the program returns to the main() function
and re-enters the while loop. This process is ended when the value, 5, is entered and the while
loop is exited using a break command. 

Output of the program was verified to be correct using a standard 4-function
calculator. The included iPhone calculator was used in order to check that the
cmath functions were working properly. Another way to verify results would be to
use simple arithmetic techniques manually.
