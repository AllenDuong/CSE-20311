	From the users perspective, the program is designed to find the 
	missing side of a right triangle if the two other missing sides are 
	provided. This program works for any combination of provided sides, 
	given that the triangle is a right triangle.

	The equation that Program 3 utilizes is the Pythagorean Theorem. The 
	equation itself has two cases in regards to the arithmatic steps 
	required. To provide the user with that choice, I utlilized a 
	numerical user input and the switch function to break my program 
	into cases. From there I calcuated the missing value using the pow() 
	and sqrt() functions of the cmath.h library. Finally, the missing 
	side is displayed via an output to the user.
	
	Evaluating the program for correctness included plugging in many 
	various types of numbers. I added conditonal checks for basic errors 
	such as negative numbers or if the hypotenuse is shorter than a 
	base. Errors arise when values are entered that are beyond the 
	capacity of an double variable type.
